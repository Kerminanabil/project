        <h3>Ancient Egyptians</h3>
    <p>
  The civilization of ancient Egypt is considered one of the most important African civilizations that emerged about five thousand years ago, and lasted for more than two thousand years, and the Nile River was its center ; Where it provided fertile land on its banks and allowed farmers the opportunity to grow crops, and the Nile River was the main means of transportation for the ancient Egyptians to transport goods and transportation.

  <p> Luxor was known through different ages by many names, in its beginning it was called the city of West, then the Romans called it Thebes after that, and it was also called the city of one hundred gates, as described by the Greek poet Homer in the Iliad, and it was also called the “City of the Sun.” “The City of Light,” and “The City of the Scepter.” After the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Arabs called it “Luxor,” which is the plural plural of the word palace, as the city contained many palaces of the Pharaohs. The foundation of the city of Thebes dates back to the era of the Fourth Dynasty, around 2575 BC.

  Thebes is an ancient pharaonic museum city in Upper Egypt, and one of the capitals of ancient Egypt during the Middle and New Kingdoms during the days of the ancient Egyptians.
  
  Thebes (today Luxor) was the center of the cult of Ra, and most of the pharaohs of Egypt, especially during the modern state, were interested in building temples there for the various ancient Egyptian deities, the most important of which was Amun-Ra. There is Thebes on the eastern bank of the Nile, on which the capital, temples, and palaces of the pharaohs were built, and it had a mayor throughout the ages. Temples were considered immortal, so they were built of heavy stones, including what was called the House of the Million Years and was also built of stones. As for the palaces of the Pharaohs and the homes of the residents, they were built of mud bricks, as they are not for eternity. For this, nothing remained of the palaces of the Pharaohs, while the temples remained.
  The ancient Egyptians considered Thebes and the eastern shore of the Nile to be the abode of life, in which they live, live, and go to worship in the nearby temples. They considered the West the home of the dead, and they used to build their graves in it. So we find the Valley of the Kings in the west of Thebes with a few temples. As for the large temples, including Karnak, they were in the city of neighborhoods on the eastern bank of the Nile.

In the capital, Thebes, there are about 14 of the most important Egyptian temples, and it is currently called Luxor. Among the most famous monuments on the eastern bank of the Nile is the lobby of the columns at Karnak, which witnessed many modifications through the centuries made by many pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Ramses II and others. There is also the Luxor Temple built by Ramses II.. The main gate of the Karnak temple is located at the end of its north,In front of it were two obelisks, one of which was taken to Paris, France, in 1836 AD, and it adorns the Place de la Concorde. At the north end of the city, there is a group of Karnak temples. It was built over a period of 1500 years, to become the largest religious facility in the world. It is famous for its large colonnade of 134 columns. It has an artificial lake from the era of the pharaohs.

And between the temples of Luxor and Karnak there is the road of rams and other temples. On the west bank of the Nile was the land of the dead, where there are funerary temples and hundreds of tombs. One of the largest and most famous of these funerary temples is the Ramesseum Temple of Ramses II, dating back to the 19th Dynasty, and in its ruins there is a huge statue. On the west bank there is the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, and Deir el-Madina, the city of workers who were building the tombs of the pharaohs near them.
There is the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut (Temple of Hatshepsut) from the 18th dynasty in Deir el-Bahari, west of the Nile, and it is an architectural masterpiece. It was built during the early 15th century BC in a stepped place on a steep slope. The most famous antiquities in the West Bank are the Valley of the Kings, where the tomb of King Tutankhamun was found. It contains the tombs of Thutmose III, Ramses III, IV, V, and Seti I, and the tomb of King Horemheb and its walls are illustrated with a prominent inscription.
